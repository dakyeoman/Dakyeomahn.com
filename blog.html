      <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 18px;">1-1. AIED-CON Gold Award</p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Kaku';">I prepared a lesson plan that combines computer vision and physical education for AIED-CON at SNU.
      <br>As someone who doesn't know much about the sport of basketball, I found that asking a friend of mine to give me some feedback was very helpful in the process. 
      While working on the project, I was reminded of the AI convergence education workshop I participated in last month, where a current elementary school teacher said that there are very few AI tools that teachers can apply to the school site. I prepared a lesson plan assuming that the teacher's digital competence is sufficient, but it is definitely not an easy task considering the actual situation. It was a good experience for me as a researcher who needs to understand good users, from collecting data to thinking about how to analyze the video and how to show it. It was also an opportunity for me to gain confidence that the path I was on was the right one for me.
      I can't wait to find out more about what PE teachers need and want to use the tool in their classrooms in the second quarter of this year. </p>
        
      <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; margin-top: 18px; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 18px;"> 1-2. Prj-AIPE Kickoff Meeting </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Kaku';">On the 11th, I went to my professor's lab for the first time in a long time for the 23-1 semester kickoff meeting.
      <br>The first draft of the plan was just interviews + surveys, but the professor suggested focus groups and co-design. I think it will be an interesting session by gathering current physical education teachers. Since it is related to my major, I have a professor to ask for help, and I am expecting that teachers who were interested in IoT will be interested in AI, so it will not be an extreme process. However, it's a methodology that I've never done before, so it seems very important to plan without any loopholes first. 
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Kaku'; margin-top: 8px;">+ Attend the poster presentation<br>Today, January 19, I took some time out of the day to go to a poster presentation of last semester's independent study teams. I realized that I have a lot of different interests, and I'm really grateful that there is such a place for academic exchange. There are many topics that I need to think about how to make my research impactful, and as an audience member, it's very important to see how the presenters convey their research in speeches and posters. It was an impressive time, and I hope that in a few months, I will be able to inspire someone with my research.

      <p style="margin-bottom: 18px; margin-top: 18px;  font-weight: bolder; font-size: 18px;">  1-3. Completing the intern research recording task</p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Kaku';">Almost a month of recording with 20 participants has come to an end!
      <br>During the planning stages, I was freaking out about how I was going to drag myself away for two hours each recording task. But once we got started, I was able to end on a high note with my participants: "We overcame the tool usage issues, the mispronunciations!!! We made this perfect recording together!".

      <p>On March 18, with the help of two of my classmates from the Department of Physical Education, I conducted a pilot study of the PRJ-AIPE co-design workshop! It was a valuable time for me to learn about the vague fears I had about this method and what I needed to do to find better. Thanks again to my two friends for their help. </p>

      <p style="font-family: 'Kaku';">We have been selected to support the 2023 AI Convergence Education Student Research Long-term Project organized by the Department of AI Convergence Education at Seoul National University, and will start our new research on April 24th! The topic of the research is 
        <b>"Research on developing healthcare AI applications based on K-12 PAPS(Physical Activity Promotion System) data"</b> </p>

      <p style="font-family: 'Kaku';">Although I study HCI, fitness and health are the most important things for everyone to live a better life! As a physical education student, I decided that I wanted to teach my favorite subject, weight training, properly. I want to create a service related to weight training in the near future, and I thought it would be helpful to have some expertise, so I took the exam.
